get_next_line<br>
<br>
get_next_line is a 42 school project that involves writing a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time. The function must be able to handle multiple lines of input, reading until the end of a line (newline character) is encountered or the end of the file is reached. The goal is to implement this functionality without relying on standard C library functions like `fgets` or `getline`.<br>
