get_next_line<br>
<br>
get_next_line is a 42 school project that involves writing a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time. The function must be able to handle multiple lines of input, reading until the end of a line (newline character) is encountered or the end of the file is reached. The goal is to implement this functionality without relying on standard C library functions like `fgets` or `getline`.<br>
<br>
Function prototype:<br>
<br>
```c<br>
char *get_next_line(int fd);<br>
```<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
<br>
- The function must return a line from the given file descriptor `fd` each time it is called.<br>
- The line should include the newline character `\n` if it is present.<br>
- The function should return `NULL` when it reaches the end of the file (EOF) or when there is an error.<br>
- It should handle multiple file descriptors correctly.<br>
- The function must not leak memory.<br>
<br>
How to Compile:<br>
<br>
To compile the project, use `make`:<br>
<br>
```bash<br>
make<br>
```<br>
<br>
To clean up object files and binaries:<br>
<br>
```bash<br>
make clean<br>
make fclean<br>
```<br>
<br>
To recompile everything:<br>
<br>
```bash<br>
make re<br>
```<br>
<br>
How to Use:<br>
<br>
Include the `get_next_line.c` and `get_next_line.h` files in your project.<br>
<br>
Call the `get_next_line` function to read lines from a file:<br>
<br>
```c<br>
#include "get_next_line.h"<br>
<br>
int main()<br>
{<br>
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);<br>
    char *line;<br>
<br>
    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL)<br>
    {<br>
        printf("%s", line);<br>
        free(line);<br>
    }<br>
<br>
    close(fd);<br>
    return 0;<br>
}<br>
```<br>
<br>
Key Concepts:<br>
<br>
- File descriptors and reading from files in C.<br>
- Buffer management to handle reading and storing lines.<br>
- Memory allocation and freeing after each line is read.<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
<br>
- Make sure the function handles memory properly to avoid leaks.<br>
- The project emphasizes handling different cases for file descriptors and efficiently managing memory.<br>
